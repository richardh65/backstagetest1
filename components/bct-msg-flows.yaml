Sample JMSReceive Request Reply Input request message JMS Input Node.  Receives the XML formatted request message from the requestor application. Specifies the compact XML parser to be used. This JMS output node sends the CWF transformed request on to the Backend Response Application. The input queue of the backend application is set as the put location. The original input message is propagated to the two outputs of the FlowOder node. The First branch uses the message headers to extract the orginal reply-to queue detail. The Second branch passes the whole message tree to drive the backend application request. This compute node simply extracts the Reply-to queue details and places them in the message to be stored in the temporary store. Additionally it copies the MsgID to the CorrelID in the MQMD to enable the reply flow MQGet node to retreive the corresponding stored message.

Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			  Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path In the event of a fatal / upstream failure the Tooling Wrapper will drive the StopFlow subflow. This direct the IIB node to stop the containing message flow. The StopFlow subflow will set ExceptionMode on during the stop message flow process. Should a new message arrive during the stop flow process an exception will be thrown. Provided that the containing message flow is single threaded no new messages will be received during the stop flow processing. The ExceptionModeFlag is a fail safe.  Note To Developers: There may be a case for placing an ExceptionmodeFlagSet check on connections to the Wrapper subflow control terminal to stop replayed events being processed while the message flow is being stopped. The EvtMgr capture key information about the failed event and store it temporarily in the Environment This ToolingWrapper uses the IIB monitoring framework to emit details of the failed event and includes a bitstream of the original data. Note: The Wrapper will have inserted an MQRFH2 header at the head of the data. This houses key information (GroupID and sequence number) that must survive the trip through operator tooling. In this case the IIB Record and Replay service. The Evtmgr will use the Monitoring Tab to config the event. It populates the following event fields with information 	Event Name					: $Environment/Exception/SaFUUID 	- BrokerName.ExecutionGroupLabel.[ApplicationLabel].MessageFlowLabel - uniquely identify the origin of the event  	Local Transaction correlator	: $Environment/Exception/chrNumber	- Exception Number 	Parent Transaction correlator: $Environment/Exception/Text		- Exception Text 	Global Transaction correlator: $Environment/Exception/userText	- User Text In this implementation of the ToolingWrapper a IIB DataDestination configurable service available to the IIB Record and Replay WebGUI references this queue The MQ Queue Name is a promoted property that the developer sets when he includes a ToolingWrapper in the containing message flow.

FATAL events will be emitted by the IOBKEvtMgr and in this example ToolingWrapper appear in the IIB Record and Replay WebGUI. These events may be unrelated to an actual failed event and as such replaying for propagation my not be desirable. However, the operator may wish to clear this from his list of events. Replaying to the FATAL.IN DataDestination configurable service will clear the event.  At this point in time the ToolingWrapper simply throws this event away. The implementation could be changed to drive one of the other supported ReplayActions.

Manually clear the RedirectAllPermanent for the GroupID - this function does not propagate the event to an out path.  Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path  In obtaining the handle to the containing message flow the code will check whether the message flow is deployed in an application container or deployed as an independent resource (i.e. a message flow in a message flow project). In the latter case the code will obtain the handle directly from the execution group administered object. As we should be single threaded in order to maintain sequence and this message flow issued the request to stop the flow I would not expect any new messages to be processed.  The name of the containing message flow and the name of the containing application(optional) will be used by the AsyncStopflow Java code to request that integration node (broker) stop the containing message flow This Wrapper Control terminal supports the following Failed Event Management operator actions which must be set in the MQRFH2.usr.IOBK.ReplayAction field by Tooling Wrapper or message flow/subflow that drives the control terminal.   ReplayOnly: 			Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectAll:			Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			  RedirectAllPermanent: Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path  ClearRedirectAllPerm: Manually clear the RedirectAllPermanent for the GroupID - this function does not propagate the event to an out path. Insert an MQRFH2 header and initialize it Determine the original input parser such that the data payload can be reattached correctly in the message tree. Driven if the following ReplayActions are used: 	RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path 	RedirectAll:				Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			 	RedirectAllPermanent: Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path Move the Sequence Number and Sequence Group ID to the MQRFH2 such that they survive the trip throught the ToolingWrapper and tooling. The exceptionlist is passed on it will be used by the ToolingWrapper to contruct the failed event Recover the Sequence Number from the MQRFH2 for use by the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow. Manage (add entries to) the Redirection groupID list dependent on replayAction type.  ReplayOnly: 		  Don't add an entry to the list  RedirectFirstOnly:	   Add a GroupID entry to the list RedirectAll:			   Add a GroupID entry to the list and mark it as ALL=Y in the list			 RedirectAllPermanent: Add a GroupID entry to the list and mark it as PERM=Y in the list		 ClearRedirectAllPerm: Remove an entry from the GroupID list  RedirIDList SHARED ROW - IDs[n].ID or IDs[n].ID + IDs[n].ID.PERM or IDs[n].ID + IDs[n].ID.ALL RedirIDCount SHARED INTEGER - number of entries in the list The routing/filtering/redirection list management logic is as follows:  If Control Message - check if redirecting this groupID, check if LastInBatch, remove from RedirList for RedirectAll if LastInBatch but not RedirectPerm, discard CtrlMsg If not Control Message - Check if Redirecting this groupID 	If Redirecting this groupID - Are we RedirectFirst, RedirectAll or RedirectPerm? 			If RedirectFirst - remove GroupID from RedirList, strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If RedirectAll - Are we LastInBatch? 				If LastInBatch 	  - remove GroupID from RedirList, strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 				If NOT LastInBatch - strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If RedirectPerm - strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If ClearRedirectPerm - remove GroupID from RedirList DO NOT propagate at all !!! This should have already happened in IOBKWrapper_RestoreSeqNum_SetRedir and hence never execute here end 3048 Create two copies of the failed event message - Order of delivery is not actually important One copy is sent to the ToolWrapper  Second copy is sent back into the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow as a control message A control message with the correct groupID needs to be fed back into the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow in order that the sequence group is held open. Mark the message as a control message MQRFH2.usr.IOBK.CtrlMsg = Y such that it can be filtered out when the  group id replayed. Note: On replay Control messages can be the LastInBatch (this is often but not always the case) The sequence group id is important resequence node in the StoreAndForward subflow will pick it up from the data based on the Path to Sequence Group ID The Resequence node running in failure mode will catch downstream exceptions and propagate them to its failure terminal. It will then block messages (storing them on MQ system queues) of the same Sequence GroupID until the original failure message is fed back into the Resequence Node via the Failed Event Management Wrapper, Tooling Wrapper and operational tooling.  Basic Properties 	Path to Sequence Number: $LocalEnvironment/Sequence/Number 	Path to Sequence Group ID: Promoted (repeatedly through the StoreAndForward/Wrapper/ToolingWrapper) to containing message flow to be set by the developer. The Group ID is the &quot;key&quot; typically made up of one 	of more elements from the headers or data payload by which the resequence node will group messages. 	Missing Message Timeout: 999999 	Start of Sequence Definition: Literal:1 	End of Sequence Definition: Automatic:300 (seconds of inactivity for that groupID) Advanced Properties 	Persistence Mode: Non-persistent for testing purposes ( restarting the queue manager will clean up the grouping messages and events on the systems queues. 	Persistence Mode: Persistent may be the preferred setting for production Retry Properties 	Retry Mechanism: Failure Instances 	Additional Instances: 0 - The output side of the resequence node is a separate thread. Single thread the output side such that sequence is maintained.   If the Resequence node itself failed rather than a downstream error there will be no LocalEnvironment/Sequence/Group. Resequence Node exceptions will be thrown back to the containing message flow as a FATAL error. The containing message flow should then be stopped. Data content - Transport Headers:MQRFH2:payload data Messages that will flow through this terminal are: First time , replayed, redirecting, control and linked (unblocked) Messages that have failed to be delivered downstream will flow through this terminal having been thrown back and caught by the Resequence Node configured for Retry Mechanism = Failure If the resequence node itself suffers an exceptions that will have been filtered out and thrown back.  This Tooling Wrapper implements the following Failed Event Management operator actions:   ReplayOnly: 			Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectAll:			Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			  RedirectAllPermanent: Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path  ClearRedirectAllPerm: Manually clear the RedirectAllPermanent for the GroupID - this function does not propagate the event to an out path.  This example of a Failed Event Management tooling wrapper utilizes the IIB monitoring framework for failed event capture and the IIB Record and Replay as the operational tooling for logging and replay. Driven if the following ReplayActions are used: 	RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path 	RedirectAll:				Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path.

Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			  Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path In the event of a fatal / upstream failure the Tooling Wrapper will drive the StopFlow subflow. This direct the IIB node to stop the containing message flow. The StopFlow subflow will set ExceptionMode on during the stop message flow process. Should a new message arrive during the stop flow process an exception will be thrown. Provided that the containing message flow is single threaded no new messages will be received during the stop flow processing. The ExceptionModeFlag is a fail safe.  Note To Developers: There may be a case for placing an ExceptionmodeFlagSet check on connections to the Wrapper subflow control terminal to stop replayed events being processed while the message flow is being stopped. The EvtMgr capture key information about the failed event and store it temporarily in the Environment This ToolingWrapper uses the IIB monitoring framework to emit details of the failed event and includes a bitstream of the original data. Note: The Wrapper will have inserted an MQRFH2 header at the head of the data. This houses key information (GroupID and sequence number) that must survive the trip through operator tooling.

Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path In the event of a fatal / upstream failure the Tooling Wrapper will drive the StopFlow subflow. This direct the IIB node to stop the containing message flow. The StopFlow subflow will set ExceptionMode on during the stop message flow process. Should a new message arrive during the stop flow process an exception will be thrown. Provided that the containing message flow is single threaded no new messages will be received during the stop flow processing. The ExceptionModeFlag is a fail safe.  Note To Developers: There may be a case for placing an ExceptionmodeFlagSet check on connections to the Wrapper subflow control terminal to stop replayed events being processed while the message flow is being stopped. The EvtMgr capture key information about the failed event and store it temporarily in the Environment This ToolingWrapper uses the IIB monitoring framework to emit details of the failed event and includes a bitstream of the original data.

ReplayOnly: 			Replay the original failed event directing it to is original out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path  RedirectAll:			Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			  RedirectAllPermanent: Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path  ClearRedirectAllPerm: Manually clear the RedirectAllPermanent for the GroupID - this function does not propagate the event to an out path. Insert an MQRFH2 header and initialize it Determine the original input parser such that the data payload can be reattached correctly in the message tree. Driven if the following ReplayActions are used: 	RedirectFirstOnly:	    Redirect the original failed event to an alternative out path and release all blocked events of the same GroupID to the original out path 	RedirectAll:				Redirect the original failed event and all blocked events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path. 			 	RedirectAllPermanent: Redirect the original failed event, all blocked events of the same GroupID and any new events of the same GroupID to the alternative out path Move the Sequence Number and Sequence Group ID to the MQRFH2 such that they survive the trip throught the ToolingWrapper and tooling. The exceptionlist is passed on it will be used by the ToolingWrapper to contruct the failed event Recover the Sequence Number from the MQRFH2 for use by the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow. Manage (add entries to) the Redirection groupID list dependent on replayAction type.  ReplayOnly: 		  Don't add an entry to the list  RedirectFirstOnly:	   Add a GroupID entry to the list RedirectAll:			   Add a GroupID entry to the list and mark it as ALL=Y in the list			 RedirectAllPermanent: Add a GroupID entry to the list and mark it as PERM=Y in the list		 ClearRedirectAllPerm: Remove an entry from the GroupID list  RedirIDList SHARED ROW - IDs[n].ID or IDs[n].ID + IDs[n].ID.PERM or IDs[n].ID + IDs[n].ID.ALL RedirIDCount SHARED INTEGER - number of entries in the list The routing/filtering/redirection list management logic is as follows:  If Control Message - check if redirecting this groupID, check if LastInBatch, remove from RedirList for RedirectAll if LastInBatch but not RedirectPerm, discard CtrlMsg If not Control Message - Check if Redirecting this groupID 	If Redirecting this groupID - Are we RedirectFirst, RedirectAll or RedirectPerm? 			If RedirectFirst - remove GroupID from RedirList, strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If RedirectAll - Are we LastInBatch? 				If LastInBatch 	  - remove GroupID from RedirList, strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 				If NOT LastInBatch - strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If RedirectPerm - strip RFH2 and propagate for redirection 			If ClearRedirectPerm - remove GroupID from RedirList DO NOT propagate at all !!! This should have already happened in IOBKWrapper_RestoreSeqNum_SetRedir and hence never execute here end 3048 Create two copies of the failed event message - Order of delivery is not actually important One copy is sent to the ToolWrapper  Second copy is sent back into the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow as a control message A control message with the correct groupID needs to be fed back into the StoreAndForward (resequence node) subflow in order that the sequence group is held open. Mark the message as a control message MQRFH2.usr.IOBK.CtrlMsg = Y such that it can be filtered out when the  group id replayed. Note: On replay Control messages can be the LastInBatch (this is often but not always the case) The sequence group id is important resequence node in the StoreAndForward subflow will pick it up from the data based on the Path to Sequence Group ID The Resequence node running in failure mode will catch downstream exceptions and propagate them to its failure terminal. It will then block messages (storing them on MQ system queues) of the same Sequence GroupID until the original failure message is fed back into the Resequence Node via the Failed Event Management Wrapper, Tooling Wrapper and operational tooling.  Basic Properties 	Path to Sequence Number: $LocalEnvironment/Sequence/Number 	Path to Sequence Group ID: Promoted (repeatedly through the StoreAndForward/Wrapper/ToolingWrapper) to containing message flow to be set by the developer. The Group ID is the &quot;key&quot; typically made up of one 	of more elements from the headers or data payload by which the resequence node will group messages. 	Missing Message Timeout: 999999 	Start of Sequence Definition: Literal:1 	End of Sequence Definition: Automatic:300 (seconds of inactivity for that groupID) Advanced Properties 	Persistence Mode: Non-persistent for testing purposes ( restarting the queue manager will clean up the grouping messages and events on the systems queues. 	Persistence Mode: Persistent may be the preferred setting for production Retry Properties 	Retry Mechanism: Failure Instances 	Additional Instances: 0 - The output side of the resequence node is a separate thread. Single thread the output side such that sequence is maintained.   If the Resequence node itself failed rather than a downstream error there will be no LocalEnvironment/Sequence/Group. Resequence Node exceptions will be thrown back to the containing message flow as a FATAL error. The containing message flow should then be stopped. Data content - Transport Headers:MQRFH2:payload data Messages that will flow through this terminal are: First time , replayed, redirecting, control and linked (unblocked) Messages that have failed to be delivered downstream will flow through this terminal having been thrown back and caught by the Resequence Node configured for Retry Mechanism = Failure If the resequence node itself suffers an exceptions that will have been filtered out and thrown back. Added to throw a convenient excption B4 IOBK to trigger StopFlow EMP05perm_1 will trigger Added to throw a convenient excption After IOBK to trigger Blocking EMP06cont_2 will trigger

Copyright International Business Machines Corporation 2005, 2010  Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Sample MQGet Request Reply Input request message MQ Input Node.  Receives the XML formatted request message from the requestor application. Specifies the compact XML parser to be used. This MQ output node sends the CWF transformed request on to the Backend Response Application. The input queue of the backend application is set as the put location. Sets the reply-to queue to be the input to the reply flow. This output node stores the extracted Reply-to queue details in the message to temporary queue store. The message is writen using the original message ID in the Correl ID field so that it can be retrevived my the MQ Get node in the rely flow. The original input message is propagated to the two outputs of the FlowOder node. The First branch uses the message headers to extract the orginal reply-to queue detail. The Second branch passes the whole message tree to drive the backend application request. This compute node simply extracts the Reply-to queue details and places them in the message to be stored in the temporary store. Additionally it copies the MsgID to the CorrelID in the MQMD to enable the reply flow MQGet node to retreive the corresponding stored message.
